  abstract = {The term Deep Learning or Deep Neural Network refers to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with multi layers. Over the last few decades, it has been considered to be one of the most powerful tools, and has become very popular in the literature as it is able to handle a huge amount of data. The interest in having deeper hidden layers has recently begun to surpass classical methods performance in different fields; especially in pattern recognition. One of the most popular deep neural networks is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It take this name from mathematical linear operation between matrixes called convolution. CNN have multiple layers; including convolutional layer, non-linearity layer, pooling layer and fully-connected layer. The convolutional and fully-connected layers have parameters but pooling and non-linearity layers don't have parameters. The CNN has an excellent performance in machine learning problems. Specially the applications that deal with image data, such as largest image classification data set (Image Net), computer vision, and in natural language processing (NLP) and the results achieved were very amazing. In this paper we will explain and define all the elements and important issues related to CNN, and how these elements work. In addition, we will also state the parameters that effect CNN efficiency. This paper assumes that the readers have adequate knowledge about both machine learning and artificial neural network.},

We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

These different kernels may correspond to using different notions of similarity or may be using information coming from multiple sources (different representations or different feature subsets). In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels, whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.},

It is important to incorporate such knowledge into the classification method at hand. A very common type of a-priori knowledge is transformation invariance of the input data, e.g. geometric transformations of image-data like shifts, scaling etc. Distance based classification methods can make use of this by a modified distance measure called tangent distance. We introduce a new class of kernels for support vector machines which incorporate tangent distance and therefore are applicable in cases where such transformation invariances are known.

However, the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different aggregation functions hard.

Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling windows are no significant improvement over non-overlapping pooling windows.

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in object recognition is the development of image representations that are invariant to common transformations such as translation, rotation, and small deformations. There are multiple hypotheses regarding the source of translation invariance in CNNs. One idea is that translation invariance is due to the increasing receptive field size of neurons in successive convolution layers. Another possibility is that invariance is due to the pooling operation. We develop a simple a tool, the translation-sensitivity map, which we use to visualize and quantify the translation-invariance of various architectures. We obtain the surprising result that architectural choices such as the number of pooling layers and the convolution filter size have only a secondary effect on the translation-invariance of a network. Our analysis identifies training data augmentation as the most important factor in obtaining translation-invariant representations of images using convolutional neural networks.},

Now, the incorporation of prior knowledge into SVMs is the key element that allows to increase the performance in many applications. This paper gives a review of the current state of research regarding the incorporation of two general types of prior knowledge into SVMs for classification. The particular forms of prior knowledge considered here are presented in two main groups: class-invariance and knowledge on the data. The first one includes invariances to transformations, to permutations and in domains of input space, whereas the second one contains knowledge on unlabeled data, the imbalance of the training set or the quality of the data. The methods are then described and classified into the three categories that have been used in literature: sample methods based on the modification of the training data, kernel methods based on the modification of the kernel and optimization methods based on the modification of the problem formulation. A recent method, developed for support vector regression, considers prior knowledge on arbitrary regions of the input space. It is exposed here when applied to the classification case. A discussion is then conducted to regroup sample and optimization methods under a regularization framework.},

This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning machines that use a central concept of SVMs -kernels--for a number of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. Learning with Kernels provides an introduction to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years.},

  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks require a large corpus of training data in order to effectively learn, where collection of such training data is often expensive and laborious. Data augmentation overcomes this issue by artificially inflating the training set with label preserving transformations. Recently there has been extensive use of generic data augmentation to improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) task performance. This study benchmarks various popular data augmentation schemes to allow researchers to make informed decisions as to which training methods are most appropriate for their data sets. Various geometric and photometric schemes are evaluated on a coarse-grained data set using a relatively simple CNN. Experimental results, run using 4-fold cross-validation and reported in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy, indicate that cropping in geometric augmentation significantly increases CNN task performance.},

  abstract = {The aim of this book is to discuss the fundamental ideas which lie behind the statistical theory of learning and generalization. It considers learning from the general point of view of function estimation based on empirical data. Omitting proofs and technical details, the author concentrates on discussing the main results of learning theory and their connections to fundamental problems in statistics. These include: - the general setting of learning problems and the general model of minimizing the risk functional from empirical data - a comprehensive analysis of the empirical risk minimization principle and shows how this allows for the construction of necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency - non-asymptotic bounds for the risk achieved using the empirical risk minimization principle - principles for controlling the generalization ability of learning machines using small sample sizes - introducing a new type of universal learning machine that controls the generalization ability.},

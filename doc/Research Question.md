###### Research Questions

Why would ensemble training be used to incorporate invariances in classification by training multiple support vector machines on virtual support vector subsets?  



###### Sub questions

How does the number of sub machines affect the accuracy of the complete machine?

How should the virtual support vectors be divided over the support vector machines?

Should VSV subsets be chosen uniformly according to the bootstrap aggregating model, or selected with a priori knowledge. 

To what extent can a speedup be achieved by training multiple support vector machines on subsets of virtual support vectors, instead of one machine on all virtual support vectors?

How should the predictions of multiple support vector machines be combined?
